Such a tool could be used to detect imbalances in the distribution of activities that could be reduced by means of public policies."

However, the methodology proposed could be applied to other cities to explore possible imbalances and sketch remediation actions."

    "The data used for this project will be obtained from Foursquare (https://es.foursquare.com/) and from Santander Datos Abiertos (http://datos.santander.es/)). Information on businesses will be obtained from Foursquare, while Santander Datos Abiertos will provide information about administrative boundaries, zip codes, parking spaces per area and population. All the data is combined into a dataframe that contains all the explicative variables for every section of the city. The so formed dataset will be the working dataset for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A clustering algorithm will then be used to classify the different section into groups of similar sections. The total number of clusters will be selected in such a way that the clustering is compatible with the field experience, that is, ensuring that each cluster really represent a quantity and quality of activity that can be observed on the field. The information collected breaks the city of Santander into several sections."
